                <h3>
                    Ever since taking my first step at South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, I have been ecstatic at knowing that I will soon be able to apply the knowledge of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics in the working world. I was first interested in coding when I took a beginner computer class freshman year of high school. It amazed me of all the incredible things you could do with learning new coding languages. Having no experience or knowledge in computer science, I was not aware of the many jobs and opportunities out there. I further researched the profession and fell in love with it.
                </h3>
                <h3>
                    Being my first experience in the world of programming, I have been working to expand my knowledge to learning many codes such as C++, Java, SQL, and HTML. This is why I decided to create this website – to reach out to possible employers while also being able to apply my knowledge to something other    than my school work.
                </h3>
                <h3>
                    I’m looking for a career where I can go and apply my knowledge, putting my skills to a great cause while seeing it affect a large variety of people in a community.
